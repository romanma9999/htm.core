# NetworkAPI Predefined Region Types
There are a number of predefined C++ region implementations that are included in the htm.core library. These do not need to be registered.  There are also Python implemented regions and user written C++ regions that can act as plugins. These will need to be registered so they can be loaded at run-time.

The built-in C++ region implementations that are included in the htm.core library are:
- ScalarEncoderRegion  - encodes numeric and category data
- RDSEEncoderRegion   - encodes numeric and category data using a hash
- DateEncoderRegion   - encodes date and/or time data
- SPRegion      - HTM Spatial Pooler implementation
- TMRegion      - HTM Temporal Memory implementation
- FileOutputRegion  - Writes data to a file
- FileInputRegion   - Reads data from a file
- ClassifierRegion  - An SDR classifier



## ScalarEncoderRegion
A ScalarEncoderRegion encapsulates the ScalarEncoder algorithm, an SDR encoder for numeric or category values. As a network runs, the client will specify new encoder inputs by setting the "sensedValue" parameter or connect a data stream to its 'values' input. An assignment to the 'sensedValue' parameter will override the input stream. On each compute cycle, the ScalarSensor will encode its input into the output. The algorithom determines the number of buckets and then encodes input such that the input results in the required number of bits in the resulting pattern such that there are no overlapping bits for values in a bucket.   See HTM School videos for more insite into how this works.

These four (4) members define the total number of bits in the output pattern:
- size (or n),
- radius,
- category,
- resolution.

These are mutually exclusive and only one of them should be provided when
constructing the encoder.

These two (2) members define the number of bits per bucket in the output:
- sparsity,
- activeBits (or w).

These are also mutually exclusive and only one of them should be provided when constructing the encoder.

Note that the output is an array of boolean values in a pattern and is output in an SDR.  However, this is not a true SDR in that it is not sparse. This pattern should be passed to an SPRegion to set the sparsity.

## RDSEEncoderRegion
A RDSEEncoderRegion region encoder encapsulates the RandomDistributedScalarEncoder(RDSE) algorithm, an SDR encoder for numeric or category values. This is similar to the ScalarSensor region encoder except that the minimum and maximum values do not need to be known and it generates a hash that is encoded thus giving a better spread of values.

As a network runs, the client will specify new encoder inputs by setting the "sensedValue" parameter or connect a data stream to its 'values' input. An assignment to the 'sensedValue' parameter will override the input stream if both are given. On each compute cycle, the ScalarSensor will encode its input into the output. The algorithom hashes the input and the hashed value determines the number of buckets. It then encodes this hashed value such that the input results in the required number of bits in the resulting pattern such that there are no overlapping bits for values in a bucket. 

These four (3) members define the total number of bits in the output pattern:
- radius,
- category,
- resolution.

These are mutually exclusive and only one of them should be provided when
constructing the encoder.

These two (2) members define the number of bits per bucket in the output:
- sparsity,
- activeBits.

These are also mutually exclusive and only one of them should be provided when
constructing the encoder.

Note that the output is an array of boolean values in a pattern and is output in an SDR.  However, this is not a true SDR in that it is not sparse. This pattern should be passed to an SPRegion to set the sparsity.

## DateEncoderRegion
The DateEncoderRegion region encapsulates the DateEncoder algorithm.
It encodes up to 6 attributes of a timestamp value into an array of 0's and 1's.
 
The input is a timestamp which is unix date/time; an integral value representing the number of
seconds elapsed since 00:00 hours, Jan 1, 1970 UTC (the unix EPOCH).  Some platforms (unix and linux)
allow negitive numbers as the timestamp which allows time before EPOCH to be expressed.
However some platforms (windows) allow only positive numbers.  If the type time_t on your computer
is is 32bits then the timestamp will not allow dates after Jan 18, 2038. By default, on windows
it is 64bit but on some older 32bit linux machines time_t is 32bit. google "Y2K38".

The output is an array containing 0's except for a contiguous block of 1's for each
attribute member. This is held in an SDR container although technically this is not
a sparse representation. It is normally passed to a SpatialPooler which will turn
 this into a true sparse representation.
 
The *_width parameters determine if an attribute is used in the encoding. If non-zero, it indicates the number of bits to dedicate to this attribute.  The more bits specified relative to the other attributes, the more important that attribute is in the resulting semantic pattern.

## SPRegion
The SPRegion encapsulates the HTM Spatial Pooler algorithm 
      described in 'BAMI 
      <https://numenta.com/biological-and-machine-intelligence/>'.   The Spatial Pooler is responsible for creating a sparse distributed representation of the input. Given an input it computes a set of sparse
active columns and simultaneously updates its permanence, duty cycles, etc.

<tr><td> inputWidth  </td><td>Maximum size of the 'bottomUpIn' input to the SP. 
                    This is the input Dimension. The input buffer width

                    buffers that are connected to the input. </td><td> ReadOnly </td><td> UInt32 </td><td> 0 </td></tr>
<tr><td> potentialRadius  </td><td> This parameter determines the extent of the input that 
                    each column can potentially be connected to. This can 
                    be thought of as the input bits that are visible to 
                    each column, or a 'receptiveField' of the field of 
                    vision. A large enough value will result in 'global 
                    coverage', meaning that each column can potentially 
                    be connected to every input bit. This parameter defines 
                    a square(or hyper square) area: a column will have a 
                    max square potential pool with sides of length 
                    '2 * potentialRadius + 1'. Default '0'.

          give each column a unique potential pool when a large potentialRadius 
          causes overlap between the columns.At initialization time we choose 
          ((2 * potentialRadius + 1) ^ (# inputDimensions) * potentialPct) input bits

          inhibition logic will insure that at most N columns remain ON

                    purpose of this is to prevent 
                    noise input from activating 
                    columns.Specified as a percent of a fully

<tr><td> synPermConnected  </td><td>The default connected threshold.Any synapse whose

<tr><td> minPctOverlapDutyCycles  </td><td> A number between 0 and 1.0, used to set a

          inhibition radius and sets its own internal minimal acceptable duty 
          cycle to : minPctDutyCycleBeforeInh * max(other columns' duty cycles).  
          On each iteration, any column whose overlap duty cycle falls below this 
          computed value will  get all of its permanence values boosted up by 
          synPermActiveInc. Raising all permanences in response to a sub-par 
          duty cycle before  inhibition allows a cell to search for new inputs 
          when either its previously learned inputs are no longer ever active, or 
          when the vast majority of them have been 'hijacked' by other 
          columns. </td><td> ReadWrite </td><td> Real32 </td><td> 0.001 </td></tr>

          have similar activeDutyCycles as their neighbors, which will lead to more 
          efficient use of columns. However, too much boosting may also lead to 
          instability of SP outputs. </td><td> ReadWrite </td><td> Real32 </td><td> 0.0 </td></tr>

## FileOutputRegion
FileOutputRegion is a region that takes its input stream and
writes it sequentially to a file. Note: this originally was VectorFileEffector.
The current input is written (but not flushed) to the file
each time the effector is executed.
The file format for the file is a space-separated list of numbers, with
one vector per line:
   ```
          e11 e12 e13 ... e1N
          e21 e22 e23 ... e2N
             :
          eM1 eM2 eM3 ... eMN
   ```

                            must be set at runtime before 
                            the first compute is called. Throws an 
                            exception if it is not set or 
                            the file cannot be written to. </td><td> ReadWrite </td><td> String </td><td> (required input) </td></tr>

## FileInputRegion
FileInputRegion is a basic sensor region for reading files containing vectors.
Note: this originally was VectorFileSensor.
      
FileInputRegion reads in a text file containing lists of numbers
and outputs these vectors in sequence. The output is updated
each time the sensor's compute() method is called. If
repeatCount is > 1, then each vector is repeated that many times
before moving to the next one. The sensor loops when the end of
the vector list is reached. The default file format
is as follows (assuming the sensor is configured with N outputs):
      ```
        e11 e12 e13 ... e1N
        e21 e22 e23 ... e2N
          : 
        eM1 eM2 eM3 ... eMN
      ```
In this format the sensor ignores all whitespace in the file, including newlines.
If the file contains an incorrect number of floats, the sensor has no 
way of checking and will silently ignore the extra numbers at the end of 
the file.

The sensor can also read in comma-separated (CSV) files following the format:
      ```
        e11, e12, e13, ... ,e1N
        e21, e22, e23, ... ,e2N
          : 
        eM1, eM2, eM3, ... ,eMN
      ```
When reading CSV files the sensor expects that each line contains a new vector.
Any line containing too few elements or any text will be ignored. If 
there are more than N numbers on a line, the sensor retains only the first N.

## ClassifierRegion
This is a wrapper around the SDRClassifier algorithm. Used to map SP and TM output back to original entries. The SDR Classifier takes the form of a single layer classification network (NN). It accepts SDRs as input and outputs a predicted distribution of categories.

Note that this will require many samples of every quantized value or category during the learning phase in order to get reasonable results.

/**
 *
 * Represents a link; a data flow connection between regions in a Network.
 *
 * How to use Links:  The big picture.
 *
 * At Configuration time.
 *
 * An application writer would define a pair of links as in the following
 * example given the declaration of a network and three regions,
 *  | Network net;
 *  | auto region1 = net.addRegion("region1", "TestNode", "{count: 64}");
 *  | auto region2 = net.addRegion("region2", "TestNode", "{dim: [64,2]}");
 *  | auto region3 = net.addRegion("region3", "TestNode", "");
 *
 * We can define links from both region1 and region2 into region3 as follows.
 *  | net.link("region1", "region3");
 *  | net.link("region2", "region3");
 *
 * Since only the region names are given, the links connect from the outputs
 * defined as Default in the Spec of each source regions into the input defined as
 * default in the Spec of the destination region (region3 in this case).
 *
 * If we want to be more specific as to which inputs and outputs on each
 * region are to be used, we could use some of the optional fields.
 *  | net.link("region1", "region3", "", "", "bottomUpOut", "bottomUpIn");
 *  | net.link("region2", "region3", "", "", "bottomUpOut", "bottomUpIn");
 *
 * This is equivalent to the link definitions above because the input and outputs
 * specified are the defaults for the 'TestNode' region used in this example.
 *
 * The application must make sure that the right dimensions are configured.
 * Every input and output must end up with a dimension when initialization
 * is called. This can be done as follows:
 *
 * - Fixed Size
 *   If an input or output has the 'count' field in its Spec set to
 *   a non-zero value, this means the region expects the input or output to be
 *   a fixed size.  In this case the size cannot be manually specified.
 *   This fixed size overrides all other Dimensions on this input or output.
 *
 * - Explicit declaration
 *   Dimensions can be manually defined for an input or output as follows:
 *   |   region1->setInputDimensions("bottomUpIn", dim);
 *   |   region1->setOutputDimensions("bottomUpOut", dim);
 *
 * - Declared for region
 *   Dimensions can be manually defined for a region.  Region dimensions are
 *   not directly tied to an input or an output but rather are for the region
 *   as a whole. The region dimensions can be manually defined as follows:
 *   |   region1->setDimensions(dim);
 *
 *   The 'regionLevel' field in the input or output spec relates it
 *   to the region dimensions.
 *
 *   If an input is specified (either directly or by inheriting from its
 *   connected output) and its 'regionLevel' field is true, then its dimensions
 *   will be propogated to the region dimensions.  It can also flow the other
 *   direction. If the region dimensions is specified and the input and its
 *   connected output are not, the input will inherit the region dimensions
 *   and it will also be propogated to the input's connected output.
 *
 *   If an output is defined with the 'regionLevel' field true and the region
 *   dimension is specified, that output will inherit the region dimensions.
 *   The reverse is also true. An output with dimensions can set the region
 *   dimensions if it has not already been set.

 * - Region Dimensions can also be configured on a region using region parameters
 *   as described below.  The advantage is that it can then be included in the
 *   yaml parameter set that is prepared for the application as a whole.
 *   |   auto region2 = net.addRegion("region2", "TestNode", "{dim: [64,2]}");
 *   The 'dim' parameter is a global parameter that is not specifically defined
 *   for a region in the spec. It can be used with any region to set the region's
 *   dimensions.
 *
 * - Dimensions can be indirectly specified for an input or output by the
 *   region implementation when asked for dimensions during initialization.
 *   So, during initialization, the engine attempts to resolve dimensions
 *   for all inputs and outputs.  If an output does not have a dimension
 *   explicitly defined, it will next ask the associated region impl for a
 *   dimension by calling region->askImplForOutputDimensions(output_name);
 *   The region can override this function and provide anything it wants to
 *   ususally something computed from its parameters.  If it does not
 *   override this function, or returns DONTCARE, the base class will call it
 *   with region->getNodeOutputElementCount(output_name) for a 1D dimension.
 *   If this function is not overridden, the base class will return DONTCARE
 *   which tells the engine to use the region in an attempt to derive the dimensions.
 *   Here is an example:
 *   |   auto region1 = net.addRegion("region1", "TestNode", "{count: 64}");
 *
 *   In this case, the 'count' parameter is something that is defined in the
 *   region Spec for the TestNode region.  Other regions may use different
 *   fields to determine buffer sizes.  The 'TestNode' region uses this
 *   to apply a 1D dimension to its 'bottomUpOut' output when it gets asked
 *   for dimensions during initialization.  OR, it could set the region
 *   dimensions directly and let propogation set the dimensions of the inputs
 *   and outputs.  Note that if the count parameter on the TestNode had a
 *   default value, everything will get configured without the application
 *   implementer needing to specify any dimensions or buffer sizes.
 *
 * At initialization time:
 *
 *   the linking logic will create the links between the regions as defined,
 *   determine the dimensions of all inputs and outputs, and then
 *   create the Array buffers for each input and output which match the type
 *   defined in each region's Spec and consistant with it's dimensions.
 *
 *   The Link logic tries to derive any unspecified dimensions so if an
 *   input still does not have a dimension after checking for direct assignment
 *   of a dimension and asking the region for one, it will look at the other
 *   end of its link and propagate the dimensions of the connected output.
 *   But if it still does not have a dimension it will get it from its region
 *   dimension if it was marked as 'regionLevel' in the spec and also propogate
 *   that to its connected output.
 *
 *   If an output does not have a dimension after checking for direct assignment
 *   of a dimension and asking its region for one, it will then try to propogate
 *   the region dimension if this output was marked as 'regionLevel' in the spec.
 *   If it still does not have a dimension, it tries to get it from its connected
 *   input as indicated above.
 *
 *   As it is propagating dimensions there may be a FanIn condition. This is
 *   where more than one output connects to a single input.  In this case the
 *   buffers of all connected outputs are concatinated into the input's buffer.
 *   If the output's dimensions very only in the upper dimension (slowest moving
 *   indexed when being traversed in C) the the input's dimensions will be the
 *   same except that the upper dimension will be the sum of all of the top
 *   level dimensions from the outputs.  example: [100,4] + [100,6] => [100,10].
 *   If the output dimensions are not consistent then everything is flattened
 *   and the input will have the 1D dimensions which is the total number of
 *   elements.  However, if the input also has been configured with dimensions
 *   it will use that as long as the total number of elements are the same.
 *
 *   Once all dimensions are set, Array buffers are created for each input
 *   and output which match the type specified in its spec and the size is
 *   set by its dimensions. The buffers are zero filled.
 *
 *   If an output is configured with a propagation delay, a delay queue is
 *   created and populated with zero filled buffers.
 *
 * At Runtime:
 *   For each iteration, the engine walks through all regions in phase order.
 *   It first prepares the inputs for a region and then calls compute()
 *   on the region which executes the region's algorithm.
 *
 *   Preparing a input for a region means propagating outputs on the other
 *   end of the link into our inputs on our region. If the buffer types are
 *   not the same on each end of the link, a data conversion takes place during
 *   the propagation.  If the types are the same on both ends of the link and
 *   no propagation delay specified, and it is not a FanIn condition, then
 *   the Array is propogated along the link as a shared_ptr and the actual
 *   data does not require a copy.
 *
 *   After the compute() is complete, the algorithm will have left the output
 *   in the output buffer setup during the initialization.
 *   The cycle repeats.

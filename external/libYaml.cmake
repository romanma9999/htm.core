# This downloads and builds the libyaml library.
#
# libyaml  - This is a SAX parser which means that it performs callbacks
#            or returns tokens for each symbol it parses from the yaml text.  
#            Therefore the interface (Value.cpp) must create the internal structure.
#            This is a YAML 1.1 implementation.
#
#            The current release is 0.2.2
#            The repository is at https://github.com/yaml/libyaml
#            Documentation is at https://pyyaml.org/wiki/LibYAML
#
#            There is a problem in version 0.2.2; it does not build.
#            Use the current master.
